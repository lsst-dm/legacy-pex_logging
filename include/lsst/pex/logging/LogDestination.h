/**
 * @brief an encapsulation of a logging stream that will filter messages
 * based on their volume (importance) level.  
 *
 * Multiple destinations can be added to a Log either at its
 * contruction time or later using one of its addDestination()
 * methods.  A LogDestination can be added to multiple Logs; however,
 * actual writing to streams is not synchronized, so the output will
 * get garbled if multiple threads or processes write to the same
 * stream simultaneously.
 * 
 * A LogDestination has its own importance threshold associated with it that 
 * is in addition to a Log's threshold.  If the threshold of a destination
 * is higher than that associated with its Log, then the destination threshold
 * will override the Log's in preventing message from being recorded.  This 
 * allows some destinations to be more verbose than others.
