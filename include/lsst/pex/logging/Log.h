/**
 * @brief a place to record messages and descriptions of the state of 
 * processing. 
 *
 * This class is the centerpiece of the logging framework.  It allows modules
 * to record plain text statements about what is happening (including errors,
 * warnings, status information, and debugging messages) as well as typed
 * data delivered as named properties.  It allows users to conveniently
 * tag their messages with a hierarchical label that can indicate where in 
 * the application the message originates.  Messages sent to a Log can be 
 * routed to multiple destinations, such as to the terminal screen, to 
 * a file and to the Event system, all simultaneously.  Messages are also 
 * tagged with an importance or "loudness" level, and Logs control their 
 * verbosity via importance thresholds.  If a message's importance level is 
 * less than the Log's threshold, it will not be recorded.  This allows 
 * applications and modules to selectively turn on and off, say, debugging 
 * messages of which there may be a great number.  Thresholds are enforced 
 * in a way to minimize the impact of unrecorded messages on overall 
 * performance, so debugging messages can remain permanently compiled into 
 * the code.  Finally, the different streams that receive log messages can 
 * have their own thresholds set as well; this allows one to, for example, 
 * send more messages to a file than to the screen.
 * 
 * Logs used by an application are organized into a hierarchy.  Applications 
 * normally get the root Log via the static method Log::getDefaultLog().  This
 * log by default is configured to print messages to the screen (although
 * a production application will typically replace the default Log with one 
 * that sends messages elsewhere).  Alternatively, an application can configure
 * its own root Log via the Log constructors, or with the convenience 
 * subclasses, ScreenLog and DualLog (used to send messages to both the screen
 * and a file).  It is possible to have multiple, independently-configured 
 * Log hierarchies, but it is intended that one is sufficient for an entire 
 * application.  
 * 
 * A root Log has an empty string name associated with it.  A module will 
 * usually create a "child" or "descendent" Log object to send its messages 
 * to, giving it a period-delimited name and a importance threshold:
 * 
 *     Log mylog(Log::getDefaultLog(), "myapp.mymod", Log::INFO);
 *
 * or 
 *
 *     scoped_ptr<Log> 
 *           mylog(getDefaultLog().createChildLog("myapp.mymod", Log::INFO));
 *
 * The new log will have the name "myapp.mymod" and allows messages at least 
 * as "loud" as Log::INFO.  The defined levels, FATAL, WARN, INFO, DEBUG (set 
 * to 20, 10, 0, -10, respectively) are conventional notions to encourage 
 * uniformity of levels across modules.  The sub-names between the periods
 * indicate the levels of the Logging hierarchy.  Note that once a threshold
 * is set for a log at a particular level, it is remembered even after that
 * log is deleted; when anther log is created with that name, its previous
 * threshold is preserved.  If no threshold is provided, it will default to 
 * that of its parents log.  Furthermore, setting the threshold for a parent
 * automatically updates the threshold for all of its descendents that have 
 * not otherwise set the threshold.  For example,
 *
 *   Log root = Log::getDefaultLog();   // the root log; name is an empty string
 *   Log applog(root, "myapp");         // myapp: a child log
 *   Log *modlog = applog.createChildLog("mymod", Log::WARN);
 *                                      // myapp.mymod: a quieter grandchild log
 *   delete modlog;
 *   modlog = applog.createChildLog("mymod")  // still set to Log::WARN
 *   
 *   root.setThreshold(log::DEBUG);     // root and applog now set to Log::DEBUG
 *   modlog.resetThreshold();           // modlog now also set to Log::DEBUG
 * 
 * As you can see in the example, names are set relative to their parent.  
 * That is, when we use a log called "myapp" to create a child called 
 * "mymod", the full name is "myapp.mymod".  This allows a Log to be made 
 * a member of a class and given a name without knowing the context in which 
 * the class is being used.  Note that it is not necessary to create
 * logs at intervening levels; the first example above, shows us directly 
 * creating a "grandchild" from the root Log.  
 *
 * Simple text log messages can be recorded with the log() functions:  
 * 
 *     mylog.log(Log::WARN, "Skipping initialization");
 *     mylog.log(Log::WARN, boost::format("Found only %d objects") % nobj);
 *
 * For more complex messages that might include named properties, it is usually
 * more convenient to use the streaming method:
 * 
 *     using lsst::pex::logging::Rec;
 *     using lsst::pex::logging::Prop;
 *     Rec(mylog, Log::DEBUG) << "Completed deconvolution"
 *                            << Prop("iterations", 541)
 *                            << Prop("rms", 0.0032)
 *                            << Rec::endr;   
 *
 *     Rec(mylog, Log::INFO) << boost::format("applying %s kernel") % kern
 *                           << Prop("width", width);
 *                           << Rec::endr;
 * 
 * The manipulator Rec::endr triggers the recording of the message to the log. 
 * Note that Rec is a shorthand typedef for the LogRec class.
